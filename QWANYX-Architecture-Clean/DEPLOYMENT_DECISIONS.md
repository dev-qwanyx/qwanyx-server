# Deployment Architecture Decisions
Date: August 20, 2024

## Current Deployment Setup âœ…

### What We Have Now (Working)
- **Build Location**: On production server
- **Deployment Method**: Git push â†’ Webhook â†’ COMMANDS.sh â†’ Build & Deploy
- **Process**: 
  1. Push code to GitHub
  2. Webhook receives notification
  3. Server pulls code
  4. Server builds everything (all packages + app)
  5. PM2 restarts the app

### Current URLs
- **Production App**: http://135.181.72.183:3002
- **API**: http://135.181.72.183:5002
- **Status**: Fully functional for demo

## Decision for Next Week ðŸ“‹

### Smart Rebuilding Strategy (To Implement)
**Problem**: Currently rebuilding everything on every push (wasteful)

**Solution**: Smart COMMANDS.sh that:
- Detects which files changed
- Only rebuilds affected packages
- Only restarts necessary services

**Benefits**:
- Faster deployments (30s â†’ 5-10s)
- Less server resource usage
- Less downtime
- Reduced risk of breaking unrelated parts

### Implementation Plan (Next Week)
1. Update COMMANDS.sh with change detection
2. Add conditional rebuilding logic
3. Test with isolated changes
4. Document the new flow

## Future Considerations ðŸš€

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Learning Goal)
- **When**: After demo, when time permits
- **Why**: Industry standard, good for resume
- **Cost**: Free for 2000 minutes/month

### Option 2: Build Locally + SCP
- **When**: If server resources become limited
- **Why**: Server only runs, doesn't build
- **How**: npm build locally â†’ scp .next folder â†’ restart

### Option 3: Docker (Long-term)
- **When**: When scaling to multiple servers
- **Why**: Consistent environments, easy rollback
- **Complexity**: Higher, requires learning Docker

## Current Priorities ðŸŽ¯

1. **This Week**: Keep current setup (it works!)
2. **For Demo Sunday**: Focus on features, not infrastructure
3. **Next Week**: Implement smart rebuilding
4. **Future**: Evaluate CI/CD options based on project growth

## Notes
- Current setup is unconventional but functional
- Building on server works fine for single server setup
- API integration is working correctly
- Performance is excellent (Next.js static generation)

## Commands Reference
```bash
# Current deployment (automatic via webhook)
git push origin main

# Manual deployment if needed
ssh root@135.181.72.183
cd /opt/qwanyx/apps/qwanyx-server/QWANYX-Architecture-Clean
git pull
./COMMANDS.sh

# Check status
pm2 list
pm2 logs autodin-next
```
